Step 1: Set Up Your Repository

    If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository for your project.

    Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakaprima/github_ci_cd_examples.git
```

Navigate into your project directory:

``` bash
cd <repository_name>
```

Step 2: Create a Workflow File

    Inside your repository, create a directory named .github/workflows if it doesn't already exist:

``` bash

    mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

    Inside the .github/workflows directory, create a YAML file for your workflow. You can name it whatever you like, for example, 
``` bash
create file
automation.yml
```

    Open the YAML file in your text editor.

Step 3: Define Your Workflow

In the YAML file, you'll define your workflow. Here's a basic example that runs on every push to the repository's main branch:

``` yaml

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

This workflow:

    Triggers on every push to the main branch.
    Sets up the Python environment.
    Installs project dependencies.
    Runs tests using pytest.

Step 4: Commit and Push

    Save the changes to your YAML file.

    Add and commit your changes:

    sql
``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
```

Push the changes to your repository:

```css

    git push origin main
```

Step 5: Monitor Workflow Runs

After pushing your changes, navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository. You should see your workflow listed there. GitHub Actions will automatically run your workflow based on the triggers you specified.

You can monitor the progress of your workflow runs and view any logs or errors that occur during the execution.

That's it! You've now set up GitHub Actions to automate your workflows. You can customize and expand your workflows to fit the specific needs of your project. For more advanced use cases, refer to the GitHub Actions documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions.
