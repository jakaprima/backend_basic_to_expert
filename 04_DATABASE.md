# Relational Databases (SQL):

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database.
Data Model: Organized into tables with rows and columns, with a predefined schema.
Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language).
ACID Compliance: Strong ACID compliance ensures data integrity.
Use Cases: Traditional business applications, where data structure is well-defined and relationships between data are important.


# NoSQL Databases:

Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB.
Data Model: Various models including document, key-value, wide-column, or graph.
Query Language: Usually non-SQL query languages specific to each database.
Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of data and high transaction throughput.
Use Cases: Big data applications, real-time analytics, IoT, and scenarios with semi-structured or unstructured data.
# NewSQL Databases:

Examples: Google Spanner, CockroachDB, VoltDB.
Data Model: Similar to traditional relational databases but designed for distributed environments.
Scalability: Aimed at combining the benefits of traditional relational databases with the scalability of NoSQL databases.
ACID Compliance: Strong ACID guarantees.
Use Cases: Distributed systems requiring strong consistency and scalability.
# Graph Databases:

Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB.
Data Model: Represent data as nodes, edges, and properties to efficiently represent and query relationships between data entities.
Query Language: Specific query languages tailored for traversing and analyzing graph data.
Use Cases: Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and any scenario involving complex relationships.
# Time Series Databases:

Examples: InfluxDB, Prometheus, KairosDB.
Data Model: Optimized for handling time-series data, where data points are indexed based on time.
Query Language: Typically SQL-like languages or APIs optimized for time-series operations.
Use Cases: Monitoring systems, IoT applications, financial analytics, and any scenario involving time-stamped data.
# Columnar Databases:

Examples: Apache HBase, ClickHouse, Vertica.
Data Model: Store data in columns rather than rows, which can provide significant performance benefits for analytical queries.
Query Language: SQL or proprietary query languages.
Use Cases: Analytical processing, data warehousing, and scenarios where querying large datasets is common.
